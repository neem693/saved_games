Nakamura Accidentally Shoots Himself While Cleaning Handgun
<Shosei Nakamura:player#46154> will be spending some time on the disabled list after he was cleaning out a handgun when the weapon discharged. The bullet lodged itself in <Nakamura:player#46154>'s foot and he had to be rushed to the local emergency room. Manager, <Koichi Ogata:coach#1506>, will be forced to find a replacement for the injured player for the next few weeks at least. Doctors were able to remove the bullet, but <Nakamura:player#46154> will be laid up for at least a month while the wound heals.

"Normally I'm very careful when I clean my gun," a disappointed <Nakamura:player#46154> told reporters. "I guess it goes to show, you can never be sure with guns."

Team doctors are unsure whether or not this will have any long term effects on the catcher's ability to play ball.
