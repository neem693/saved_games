Kim Takes KFL #1 Pitcher Trophy
<Shi-hoon Kim:player#45957> doesn't think about his career all that much. He doesn't fixate on yesterday and he doesn't worry about next season -- he has learned to worry only about today.
That attitude, coupled with 7 saves in 9 relief appearances netted the 19-year-old reliever April's Korean Futures League Pitcher of the Month trophy earlier today.

The <Goyang:team#452> reliever pitched 8.1 innings, struck out 9 and walked 4 on the way to a 1-0 mark and a 1.08 ERA.
