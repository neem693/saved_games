Everything went the way of the <Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks:team#412>, who not only came away with the 2-1 victory over Chunichi, but also held Oshima hitless in 1 at-bat to put an end to his 22-game hitting streak.

"It was a good run," <Oshima:player#37458> said afterward. "It would be much easier to take right now if we had won."
