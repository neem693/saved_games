Modesto Reliever April's Best Pitcher 
"The kid had it all working last month," a veteran teammate told reporters. "He keeps up those kind of numbers, we might have to start inviting him out with us after the games."

<Art Warren:player#1602> put together a very solid month to take home the California League's top pitching honor in April.

The 25-year-old reliever threw like a veteran. In 11 relief appearances he raked in 8 saves and 10 strikeouts in 11.1 innings as he put together his 1-0 record and 0.00 ERA.
