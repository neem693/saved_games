Fukui at His Best, Blanks Fukuoka SoftBank
It wasn't easy but the <Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters:team#413> made it look that way.

Starter <Yuya Fukui:player#37043> shut out the <Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks:team#412> despite having what he later called "sub-par" stuff, and the <Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters:team#413> cruised to victory, 5-0. Fukui allowed only 5 hits and rang up 10 strikeouts but insisted later that he did not deserve primary credit for the win.

"It didn't feel quite right today, but I got a lot of help to get through," he said. "I trusted my catcher and the guys behind me bailed me out more than once when I screwed up."

In 7 starts this year <Fukui:player#37043> has recorded a 4-2 record and a 4.11 ERA.
