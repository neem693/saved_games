Gulf Coast Rookie League Names Top Player
So far in his young career, <Jhoiner Rodriguez:player#45511> has kept a low profile, but after his performance at the plate last week, he attracted the notice of the rest of the Gulf Coast Rookie League in a big way as he was named the Player of the Week today for his efforts.

The 18-year-old <New York A W (GCL) Yankees West:team#408> catcher hit at a torrid .643 clip as he collected 9 hits in 14 at-bats, 1 home run, 4 RBIs and 3 runs scored.
