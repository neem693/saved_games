Hit Parade: Noda Pops 5 Hits
The 5th time was not the charm for <Ryan Noda:player#1848> today.

The right fielder for the <Vancouver Canadians:team#298> hit the milestone today at PK Park, but it was the <Eugene Emeralds:team#295> that salvaged a 8-5 victory. Noda finished with a 5-for-5 line at the plate, and it still wasn't enough.

"He was not an easy out, that's for sure," <Eugene:team#295> manager <Steven Lerud:coach#2805> said to the press in the postgame interview. "I'm just glad we held everybody else in check and got the win."

Noda declined to speak to reporters at length following the game, saying only that "no loss is a good one."

<Ryan Noda:player#1848> singled in the 2nd, hit a two-run home run off <M.T. Minacci:player#20870> in the 4th, singled in the 6th, singled in the 8th and hit an RBI single in the 9th.
