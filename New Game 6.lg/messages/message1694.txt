Florial on a Rampage, Hits for Cycle
<Estevan Florial:player#587> of the <Tampa Tarpons:team#246> touched all the bases today at Charlotte Sports Park in the 8-6 victory over <Charlotte:team#240>, hitting for the cycle.

He teed off on Stone Crabs pitching, collecting 1 single, 1 double, 1 triple and 1 home run. The feat is rare in baseball as it requires a game of no fewer than four hits and the unusual combination of a home run, which requires a batter to hit for some power -- and a triple, which requires a batter to have both speed and a favorable fall of the ball.

"The hardest part was the triple," Florial confessed after the game. "A lot has to go right. It's real easy to get greedy trying to stretch a double and get thrown out. It's really hard to get a three-bagger."

He finished the big day with 4 hits in 5 at-bats, 3 RBI, 2 runs scored -- and a place in the record books.

<Estevan Florial:player#587> doubled in the 2nd, hit a solo-shot off <Kenny Rosenberg:player#20561> in the 4th, singled in the 5th, grounded out in the 7th and hit a two-run triple in the 9th.

For the season <Florial:player#587> is currently batting .234 with 11 home runs and 44 RBIs. In 75 games he has reached base at a .322 rate and scored 44 runs to date.
