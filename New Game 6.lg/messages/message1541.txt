6-for-6 Game for Armenteros
It doesn't happen very often, but it did for <Lazaro Armenteros:player#18021> today -- a 6-hit day. He went on a rampage and sparkled on the diamond at Juan Marichal Complex, but the performance lost a little luster when the Athletics were downed 4-3 by the <New York N (DSL) Mets 1:team#602>. 

After his glittering performance, the <Oakland (DSL):team#603> center fielder told the press that he "just tried to get myself in a good count and have a good at-bat." 

His batting theory paid dividends today as he slammed 6 hits in 6 tries and put his name in the record book.

"I just wish we had added a win in the record book today, too," Armenteros said.
