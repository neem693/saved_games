Oyama Cracks 5 Hits
The <Hanshin (Ni-Gun) Tigers:team#431> stopped the <Hiroshima Toyo (Ni-Gun) Carp:team#432> by a score of 9-2 at Naruohama Baseball Ground today, with the lion's share of the credit going to third baseman <Yusuke Oyama:player#44071>. The 23-year-old had a career day, collecting 5 hits.

"Every batter wants to have a quality at-bat every time he steps up to the plate," Oyama said later. "He wants to hit the ball hard."

Oyama did just that in his 5 at-bats, much to the chagrin of the Carp.

"Not much that I can say," offered Hiroshima Toyo (Ni-Gun) manager <Katsumi Mizumoto:coach#2509>. "He just hammered the heck out of us." 

<Yusuke Oyama:player#44071> singled in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit a three-run home run off <Atsuya Horie:player#42954> in the 6th, hit an RBI single in the 7th and hit a two-run home run off <Alexander Calderon:player#41487> in the 8th.
