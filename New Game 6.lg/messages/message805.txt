Salcedo Blisters Round Rock
The 5th time was not the charm for <Edward Salcedo:player#30182> today.

The third baseman for the <Iowa Cubs:team#171> hit the milestone today at Principal Park, but it was the <Round Rock Express:team#178> that salvaged a 9-8 victory. Salcedo finished with a 5-for-7 line at the plate, and it still wasn't enough.

"He was not an easy out, that's for sure," <Round Rock:team#178> manager <Jason Wood:coach#495> said to the press in the postgame interview. "I'm just glad we held everybody else in check and got the win."

Salcedo declined to speak to reporters at length following the game, saying only that "no loss is a good one."

<Edward Salcedo:player#30182> singled in the 1st, struck out in the 3rd, hit an RBI triple in the 5th, singled in the 7th, hit a three-run home run off <Chris Martin:player#32812> in the 9th, grounded out in the 11th and singled in the 13th.
