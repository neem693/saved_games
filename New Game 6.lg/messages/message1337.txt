Nationals SS Turner Gets the Cycle
Getting 4 hits in a game is no easy feat, but doing it to hit for the cycle is even more rare. 

<Trea Turner:player#16> of the <Washington Nationals:team#60> pulled it off today at Nationals Park, going 4-for-5 against the <San Francisco Giants:team#55>. His batting escapades sparked the Nationals to a 10-9 victory.

Turner tallied 3 runs and drove in 1 during the game. Hitting for the cycle is particularly rare because of the different skills required - enough power for a home run, enough speed for a triple and enough patience at the plate to see at least four hittable balls. 

"It just happened," Turner said to reporters after the win. "Must have been fate or something, I wasn't expecting it. Heck, I wasn't even really trying for it."

<Trea Turner:player#16> hit a solo-shot off <Ty Blach:player#33013> in the 1st, flied out in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, tripled in the 7th and doubled in the 8th.
