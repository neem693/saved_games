April's Best EL Hurler is Tamura
When <Ichiro Tamura:player#44199> takes the hill, there's a good chance for a <Seibu (Ni-Gun):team#426> victory. At least that's the way it was in May.

He excelled with a 3-0 mark and a 1.27 ERA in 4 starts, tossed 28.1 innings, fanned 25, and held enemy hitters to a .124 average.

That's why the Lions star was honored today as the Pitcher of the Month by the Eastern League.
