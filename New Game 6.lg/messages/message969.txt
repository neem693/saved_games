Pirates-Reds Fight Nets 7-Game Suspensions
Sometimes on the baseball diamond disparaging words are uttered in anger and lead to more than what the players bargained for. That's what happened at yesterday's <Pittsburgh Pirates:team#52>-<Cincinnati Reds:team#37> game at PNC Park. What started off as a war of words ended up a tag team match as both clubs rushed on the field to defend their honor. When the umpires sorted it all out, they ejected <Pittsburgh:team#52>'s <David Freese:player#21442> and <Cincinnati:team#37>'s <Andury Acevedo:player#32721> from the game for their roles in starting the melee.

Today the players were notified by the league office that they had been suspended 7 games for violating league rules.

This year <Freese:player#21442> is batting .197 with 12 hits and 1 home run. He has scored 7 times and has batted in 8 runs.
