CAR Player of the Week Named
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Carolina League, but last week <Micker Adolfo:player#34976> of the <Winston-Salem Dash:team#234> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Adolfo rocked opposing pitching for a .500 average (12-for-24), 4 home runs and 12 RBIs to come away with the award.

So far this year, <Adolfo:player#34976> is batting .327 with 5 home runs and 17 RBIs.
