Salem Loses Goetze for Season
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <Salem:team#225>'s <Pat Goetze:player#35974> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 06/08/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Goetze said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Goetze has been out of action since he suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament.

Season-to-date <Goetze:player#35974> has 1 save in 27 relief appearances with a 0-4 record and 4.20 ERA.
