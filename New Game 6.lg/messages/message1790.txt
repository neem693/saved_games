Iksan's Baek KFL's Best
<Iksan:team#731>'s <Seon-ki Baek:player#45990> would not be denied the Korean Futures League Player of the Week Award for this past week. His consistent stroke, which produced 14 hits in 25 at-bats and a .560 average, made him the clear favorite to win the honor.

"You just go out there and do what you have to do," said <Baek:player#45990>, "When I'm up, I try to focus and block everything else out of my mind and have a good at-bat. I'm up there to get a hit or advance a runner, not to get caught up in the emotion of the moment. I hope I can win this award every week."

He also tallied 1 home run, 1 RBIs, and scored 5 runs.

Thus far this year <Baek:player#45990> has hit .339 with 5 home runs and 36 RBIs.
