Chiu Beaned by Pitching Machine
The 7-Eleven Lions equipment manager announced today that he would order an inspection of all the team's training equipment after a pitching machine beaned <Tsu-Kai Chiu:player#40147>. The reliever was briefly knocked unconscious after the machine lobbed an errant fastball directly at his head. Chiu, who was clearly caught off-guard by the wild throw, attempted to duck out of the ball's way, but was hit squarely in the side of the head. Fortunately for Chiu, he was wearing a helmet at the time. Still, the sheer impact left him lying motionless on the ground for a few frightening moments. "It was scary," said teammate <Yu-Kang Fu:player#40023>. "I've never seen a pitching machine throw a pitch quite like that." Chiu was attended to by coaches and teammates and was later taken to a local hospital for observation. He was diagnosed with a mild concussion and may miss a few games as a result. "I've gotta admit," Fu added, " I'm gonna be a little nervous next time I have to face one of those things!"
