Hits Galore: Kivlehan Drills 5 Hits
There aren't many who could be pro ballplayers and there are even fewer who could put up 5 hits in a day.

<Patrick Kivlehan:player#33020> is one of those rare few, as he went 5-for-5 against the <Toledo Mud Hens:team#170> at Fifth Third Field today. The monster effort from the 28-year-old first baseman helped the <Louisville Bats:team#169> take the win, 6-4. 

"We made some bad pitches and he took advantage of it," said Mud Hens manager <Doug Mientkiewicz:coach#1168>. "That's the game, though. Don't make mistakes and you'll win ballgames. Make mistakes and, well, you saw what happened today." 

<Patrick Kivlehan:player#33020> singled in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit a solo-shot off <Neal Cotts:player#17997> in the 6th, singled in the 7th and singled in the 9th.

So far on the season Kivlehan is hitting .260 with 11 home runs, 40 RBIs and 42 runs scored. He has 79 hits and played in 77 games.
