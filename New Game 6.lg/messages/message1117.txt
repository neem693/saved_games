Pensacola Loses RF Aquino, Suspended by League 
The <Pensacola Blue Wahoos:team#200> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Jacksonville:team#199> at Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville. One in particular -- <Aristides Aquino:player#36125>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Blue Wahoos right fielder gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Aquino lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Aquino told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Aquino for 3 games.

On the season, <Aquino:player#36125> is batting .285 with 4 home runs and 22 RBIs. He has played in 42 games.
