No Comeback This Season for Bickford
Clearly dejected, <Phil Bickford:player#34386> left the <Biloxi:team#201> clubhouse nearly in tears this afternoon. He acknowledged that his season is over after sustaining a bone spur in his elbow in a ballgame recently. It brings an early end to the <Biloxi:team#201> reliever's season.
