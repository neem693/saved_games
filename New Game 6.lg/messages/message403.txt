Tohoku Rakuten Blanks Buffaloes, Norimoto at His Best
The <Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles:team#415> shut out the <Orix Buffaloes:team#414> 5-0 today behind the strong pitching of <Takahiro Norimoto:player#37535>. <Norimoto:player#37535> surrendered only 3 hits in recording the complete-game victory, and struck out 14.

Following the last out, Norimoto appeared to celebrate a little too boisterously for Orix manager <Junichi Fukura:coach#1921>, who could be seen scolding the famously outspoken right-hander as the clubs left the field. Norimoto's own manager then intervened with some words for his counterpart.

The Buffaloes skipper would not comment on the exchange, but at the Golden Eagles press conference, Norimoto confirmed that it was regarding the celebration.

"He basically told me I was being a lousy winner," Norimoto said.

"And I told him he was being a lousy loser," Tohoku Rakuten manager Masataka Nashida added.
