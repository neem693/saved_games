Hartford Loses Jimenez for Season
Obviously disappointed, <Ubaldo Jimenez:player#18683> confirmed today that his season is officially over. The <Hartford:team#188> reliever offered mostly monosyllabic responses to reporters. "Nope," he said, when asked if he might possibly return this year. The 34-year-old Jimenez suffered bone chips in his elbow on 06/23/2018 and has been out of action since.

This year <Jimenez:player#18683> has made 4 relief appearances with no saves. In 14.2 innings, he has fanned 9 hitters and recorded no wins and no losses with a 3.68 ERA.
