7-Eleven Lions 3B Su Gets the Cycle
Today at Tainan City Baseball Field <Chih-Chieh Su:player#39594> tore up Monkeys pitching, but the 7-Eleven Lions still came up empty. <Lamigo:team#463> whipped them 8-5, despite his best efforts. The <Uni-President:team#462> third baseman hit for the cycle with a 4-for-5 day and collected 2 runs batted in and scored 3 runs -- but to no avail -- his team lost the game anyway.
