Fed Up With Losing, Tatsushi Masuda Snaps
After another bad loss by his Lions today <Tatsushi Masuda:player#37510>, was not a happy camper.

Specifically, he took his frustrations out on his teammate, <Ken Togame:player#37217>, getting into an "animated" argument in the clubhouse.

"It's his fault we're losing ballgames," said <Masuda:player#37510> about <Togame:player#37217>. "I was just trying to let him know that he needs to play better, and he took offense to it."

<Lions:team#416> manager <Norio Tanabe:coach#1562> commented, saying that "boys will be boys," and continued by saying, "things like this happen when we don't win."
