<Wei-Chung Wang:player#33774> of the Dinos was injured today during his routine morning jog. "I twisted my ankle while I was jogging. Doesn't seem too bad, but I'm going to get it checked out to be safe." Manager Kyung-Moon Kim commented, "I would put his odds of playing today at less than 50/50. It's just not really worth risking further injury."
