Murphy in Command, No-Hits Indians 2
<Jimmy Murphy:player#24595> really did a number on the <Cleveland (AZL) Indians 2:team#796> at Ballpark of Humboldt today -- and that number was zero.

The <San Diego (AZL) Padres 2:team#785> hurler had what he later called "one of the best moments of my life," tossing a no-hitter and leading the Padres 2 to victory, 3-0.

"This is something special," Murphy said. "I knew from the fifth inning that I had a no-hitter working. I tried to get it out of my mind, but you just can't. They have too many scoreboards in the park. They're everywhere you look."

The right-hander faced only 30 batters in the no-hit gem, struck out 7 and walked 2.

"We simply couldn't get any wood on the ball," Cleveland (AZL) manager <Jerry Owens:coach#2816> said when asked about the epic performance. "<Murphy:player#24595> was brilliant out there. He certainly had our number."
