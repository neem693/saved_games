Fire Frogs End Hudson's Streak
<Bryan Hudson:player#35562> came rolling into today's game against the <Florida Fire Frogs:team#757> with a 21-game hitting string, but he left it on the field at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium.

The 23-year-old <Dunedin Blue Jays:team#242> center fielder went 0-for-4 against the Fire Frogs as the Blue Jays fell, 3-1.

"I swung at a couple pitches I probably shouldn't have and I didn't swing at a couple I probably should have," he said, grimacing. "But that's what makes a hit streak so impressive in the first place -- it only takes a couple mistakes to end it all."

So far this year, <Hudson:player#35562> is batting .337 with 1 home run and 8 RBIs.
