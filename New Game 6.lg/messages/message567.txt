Season-Ending Injury for Pastrone
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <Burlington:team#254>'s <Sam Pastrone:player#25799> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 04/24/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Pastrone said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Pastrone has been out of action since he suffered bone chips in his elbow.
