5-for-5 Day for Erceg
It was a good day for the Shuckers at Hank Aaron Stadium as they clipped the <Mobile BayBears:team#206>, 6-5. It was tremendous day for <Lucas Erceg:player#2050>, who was on a hitting barrage at the plate, finishing 5-for-5. 

"I don't know what to call that," the <Biloxi:team#201> third baseman told reporters after his big performance. "I'm not 'dialed in' or 'in a zone,' I just try to keep it simple. Basically the pitcher throws the ball, I try to pick up the spin, then I hit it. Today I picked up the spin pretty well." 

<Lucas Erceg:player#2050> singled in the 1st, hit a solo-shot off <Greyfer Eregua:player#36419> in the 4th, doubled in the 6th, singled in the 8th and singled in the 9th.

This season <Erceg:player#2050> has hit at a .259 clip and produced 9 runs batted in, 2 home runs and 8 runs.
