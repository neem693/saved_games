Soliman Holds Indianapolis Hitless
<Manuel Soliman:player#30852> was feeling calm about his no-hitter -- until the last three outs.

"You really become conscious of every pitch at that point," he said. "The adrenaline level kicks up even higher. Everybody in the ballpark knows a no-hitter is on the line. The crowd is on its feet. One mistake and it's all over."

There were no mistakes to be had for Soliman on this day at Harbor Park. The <Norfolk Tides:team#165> right-hander was in complete command, not allowing the <Indianapolis Indians:team#168> a single base hit in the 2-0 victory.

"Obviously, you never think this will happen," he said to BNN reporters after the game. "I don't know if it's really sunk in yet."

Soliman faced 19 batters, had 4 strikeouts and gave up 2 walks in a dominating effort.

"He was on from the get-go," Indians manager <Brian Esposito:coach#1416> said. "He was hitting his spots and keeping us off balance. It was a great game by him."
