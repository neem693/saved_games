Fans at Baseball City Complex got a rare gift today as <Melvi Acosta:player#1799> of the Twins tossed a no-hitter against the <Los Angeles (DSL) Dodgers 2:team#751>.

Although Acosta did not appear to have his best stuff in the early innings, he turned masterful as the game went on, ultimately striking out 3 and walking 2 in a 1-0 Minnesota (DSL) victory.

"We had our chances in the first few innings when he was hittable, and we couldn't capitalize on them," Los Angeles (DSL) manager <Austin Chubb:coach#2704> said later. "In the last four or five innings, he totally shut us down."

In all, <Acosta:player#1799> faced only 30 batters. While getting into his groove, he was helped by several defensive gems.

"I don't remember a better-pitched game," Twins manager Robbie Robinson said. "And how about our defense today?"
