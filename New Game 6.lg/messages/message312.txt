Week's #1 Player: Chiba Lotte (Ni-Gun)'s Abreu
The baseball must have looked as big as a balloon to <Abner Abreu:player#36858> of <Chiba Lotte (Ni-Gun):team#423> last week. The first baseman had quite a 6-game stretch and today he was named the Eastern League Player of the Week.

Abreu delivered 9 hits in 26 at-bats to hit .346 with 3 home runs and 9 RBIs.
