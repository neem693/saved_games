Ha-seong Kim Makes His Pitch... Selling Cars!
Why is Ha-seong Kim suddenly so popular around his hometown? Might it have something to do with his series of TV and radio commercials for a local car dealership that has taken the city by storm?

Viewers can't seem to pin down what exactly it is about the Nexen player that is so endearing, but Kim now has a cult following around town.

"I've never sold cars in my life. To be perfectly honest, they probably just wanted a team member that fit their price range," Kim said with a hearty laugh. "I've always been that kind of guy, and I thought it was something fun to do with some free time. I'm big on supporting local businesses, too."
