CAR Awards Player of the Week Trophy
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Carolina League, but last week <Luis Aviles:player#35760> of the <Carolina Mudcats:team#231> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Aviles rocked opposing pitching for a .421 average (8-for-19), 3 home runs and 9 RBIs to come away with the award.

Aviles is hitting .265 this season with 4 home runs, 31 RBIs and 25 runs scored. He has 56 hits in 211 at-bats.
