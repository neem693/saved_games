Early Season End for Magnifico
<Damien Magnifico:player#33211> had to wait several agonizing days to find out his diagnosis after suffering a damaged elbow ligament on 04/05/2018. Today he received word from the <Altoona:team#194> doctor that he would be out the rest of the year. Team officials called it a huge setback but something they would have to overcome.
