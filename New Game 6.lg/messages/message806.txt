Missions End Kiner-Falefa's Streak
It was a doubly miserable day today for <Isiah Kiner-Falefa:player#35368> of the <Frisco RoughRiders:team#213>, as he saw his 21-game hitting streak end and his team lose 9-1 to the <San Antonio Missions:team#215> at Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium. The 23-year-old catcher was held hitless in 4 at-bats by the Missions.

"Anyone on a 21-game hitting streak is going to be a tough out," San Antonio manager <Phillip Wellman:coach#462> said later. "But we had a plan and we were careful about it, and got it done."

In his 2018 season totals, <Kiner-Falefa:player#35368> has 1 home run, .374 BA, .434 OBP, 12 RBIs and 12 runs scored.
