Season Done for Burke
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <Hiroshima Toyo (Ni-Gun):team#432>'s <Mike Burke:player#677> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 05/29/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Burke said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Burke has been out of action since he suffered a torn rotator cuff.

This year <Burke:player#677> has collected 2 saves in 12 relief appearances. He has also compiled a 0-2 won-lost mark with a 4.35 ERA and fanned 9 batters in 10.1 innings. Opponents are hitting him at a .216 clip in 2018.
