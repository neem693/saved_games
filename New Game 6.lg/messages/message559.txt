Takeda Fires Shutout in Hawks Victory
The <Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks:team#412> shut out the <Saitama Seibu Lions:team#416> 6-0 today behind the strong pitching of <Shota Takeda:player#37096>. <Takeda:player#37096> surrendered only 4 hits in recording the complete-game victory, and struck out 7.

Following the last out, Takeda appeared to celebrate a little too boisterously for Saitama Seibu manager <Norio Tanabe:coach#1562>, who could be seen scolding the famously outspoken right-hander as the clubs left the field. Takeda's own manager then intervened with some words for his counterpart.

The Lions skipper would not comment on the exchange, but at the Hawks press conference, Takeda confirmed that it was regarding the celebration.

"He basically told me I was being a lousy winner," Takeda said.

"And I told him he was being a lousy loser," Fukuoka SoftBank manager Terushi Nakashima added.

To date this year, <Takeda:player#37096> shows a 4-0 record, 5 starts, 34.2 innings, 28 strikeouts and a 3.12 ERA.
