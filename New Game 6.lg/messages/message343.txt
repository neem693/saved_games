Suzuki Goes Cycling
Some days everything just falls in place.

It all came together for <Seiya Suzuki:player#37408> and the <Hiroshima Toyo Carp:team#419> today at Meiji Jingu Stadium. The Carp went home winners and the right fielder had a 4-for-5 day that included the cycle, a baseball rarity.

"He sure was a wrecking ball today," said Hiroshima Toyo manager Koichi Ogata following his club's 14-6 taming of the <Tokyo Yakult Swallows:team#420>.

<Seiya Suzuki:player#37408> walked in the 1st, tripled in the 3rd, hit an RBI double in the 5th, singled in the 7th, struck out in the 8th and hit a GRAND SLAM off <Kentaro Kyuko:player#37386> in the 9th.

Currently <Suzuki:player#37408> is batting .250 with 1 home run and 6 RBIs.
