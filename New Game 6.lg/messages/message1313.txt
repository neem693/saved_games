Chen Injured From Slide on Wet Grass
<Chieh-Hsien Chen:player#39540> of the 7-Eleven Lions may miss a game or two after slipping on the wet grass during an afternoon warm-up at the team's practice facility. Chen and his teammates were just returning to the field after a brief rain delay when the shortstop took an awkward spill on the infield. "My feet just went out from under me," Chen explained shortly after the incident. "All I know right now is that my leg's pretty darn sore." Even though there was no immediate evidence of any serious injury, manager Lien-hung Chen told reporters after practice that he would be keeping Chen out of the 7-Eleven Lions next game "as a precaution".
