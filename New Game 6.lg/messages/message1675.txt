4-Game Suspension for Giants Merrigan
The <Yomiuri (Ni-Gun) Giants:team#428> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Tokyo Yakult (Ni-Gun):team#434> at Giants Baseball Stadium. One in particular -- <Josh Merrigan:player#23039>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Giants left fielder gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Merrigan lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Merrigan told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Merrigan for 4 games.

Currently <Merrigan:player#23039> is batting .168 with 1 home run and 15 RBIs.
