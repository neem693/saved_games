Great Week for Lamigo's Wily Mo Pena
After all of <Wily Mo Pena:player#36794>'s years in baseball, some have suggested -- albeit very delicately -- that he should think about calling it quits. But the "mature adult," as he calls himself, showed last week that he's still capable of keeping up with the youngsters. The 36-year-old <Lamigo:team#463> left fielder was honored today as the Chinese Professional Baseball League Player of the Week.

He fended off all comers by posting a .455 average with 10 hits in 22 at-bats, 6 home runs and 10 RBIs.

For the season <Pena:player#36794> is currently batting .321 with 20 home runs and 55 RBIs. In 49 games he has reached base at a .386 rate and scored 46 runs to date.
