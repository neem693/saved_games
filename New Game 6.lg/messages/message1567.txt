Obviously disappointed, <Anthony Kay:player#35198> confirmed today that his season is officially over. The <Columbia:team#276> reliever offered mostly monosyllabic responses to reporters. "Nope," he said, when asked if he might possibly return this year. The 23-year-old Kay suffered a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament on 06/21/2018 and has been out of action since.

During this season he has made 6 relief appearances, earning a 2-1 record with no saves. In 14 innings <Kay:player#35198> has struck out 6 with a 3.21 ERA.
