Hot Bat Cooled, Tanabe Hitless Against Pelicans
For 20 straight games, <Carlton Tanabe:player#30176> tried to ignore his hitting streak. It wasn't easy.

Well, the 26-year-old <Buies Creek Astros:team#758> catcher can forget about it now -- it's over, courtesy of the <Myrtle Beach Pelicans:team#232>. The Pelicans held him hitless in 7 at-bats at Jim Perry Stadium today and snapped his consecutive-game hitting string at 20.

There was at least one good note to the end of the streak, however, as the Astros took the win by the score of 1-0.

"I tried to ignore it for weeks, but you guys in the media wouldn't let me," he joked with reporters after the game. "I'm looking forward to some peace and quiet now."

This year <Tanabe:player#30176> is hitting .289, produced 17 RBIs and 3 home runs, scored 17 times and gotten on base at a .347 rate.
