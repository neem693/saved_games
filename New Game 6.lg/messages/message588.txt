Super Week for Lynchburg's Collins!
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Carolina League, but last week <Gavin Collins:player#27427> of the <Lynchburg Hillcats:team#245> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Collins rocked opposing pitching for a .476 average (10-for-21), 2 home runs and 7 RBIs to come away with the award.

<Collins:player#27427> is currently batting .295 with 3 home runs and 14 RBIs.
