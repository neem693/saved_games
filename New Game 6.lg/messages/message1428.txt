Lynn Whips Cleveland
In an impressive outing, <Lance Lynn:player#28501> whitewashed the <Cleveland Indians:team#38> 6-0.

"I'm getting a lot more downward movement instead of side to side. That side-to-side stuff can get hit a long way," said Lynn, who is throwing with more of an overhand motion.

"It's not rocket science. It was just a little adjustment, but that's all it took."

The <Minnesota:team#47> hurler held <Cleveland:team#38> scoreless, allowed 6 hits, chalked up 2 strikeouts and yielded no walks.

Up to now <Lynn:player#28501> has compiled an ERA of 3.86 with a 6-5 mark over 14 starts. He has 54 strikeouts in 77 innings and has held opponents to a .259 batting average.
