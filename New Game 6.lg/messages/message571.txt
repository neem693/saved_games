Chicago Loses 1B Rizzo, Suspended by League 
The <Chicago Cubs:team#36> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Milwaukee:team#46> at Wrigley Field. One in particular -- <Anthony Rizzo:player#25416>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Cubs first baseman gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Rizzo lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Rizzo told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Rizzo for 2 games.

<Rizzo:player#25416> is presently hitting at a .275 pace with 7 home runs and 16 RBIs. He has played in 27 games and scored 25 times.
