Im Takes Leave to Attend to 'Personal Matters'
LG star <Chan-kyu Im:player#38829> will miss the next few games to tend to "personal issues". Im refused to elaborate on what exactly the issues were, but added that they were "more important than baseball, that's for sure". Twins manager Joong-il Ryu commented that it "wouldn't be long, but we have to plan in the short-term to be without him".
