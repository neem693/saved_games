Meyer Spins No-Hitter
The no-hitter is one of baseball's truly egalitarian achievements. It's done by the great and the not-so-great alike, and for nearly all of them it represents the pinnacle of a career. <Greensboro Grasshoppers:team#268> pitcher <Ben Meyer:player#42005> had his moment today at NewBridge Bank Park, holding the <Charleston RiverDogs:team#272> hitless and beating them, 5-0.

"Everything was working for him," RiverDogs manager <Julio Mosquera:coach#304>. "He had a lot of late movement that seemed to cause the guys trouble, especially from the fifth inning on.  He was in command."

Meyer rung up 7 strikeouts, issued 1 walk and faced only 27 hitters in his historic outing. After the game, he spoke to BNN reporters in the Greensboro locker room.

"I really got nervous in the last inning," Meyer recalled. "I knew I had a chance at a no-hitter but it was hard to stay calm and concentrate. Thank goodness for my catcher. He told me he would do all the thinking and I could just concentrate on hitting his glove."
