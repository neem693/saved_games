Hawks End Shimada's Streak
The <Fukuoka SoftBank (Ni-Gun) Hawks:team#430> got more than the 5-1 victory at Naruohama Baseball Ground today -- they also put an end to the 20-game hitting streak of <Hanshin (Ni-Gun) Tigers:team#431> right fielder <Kairi Shimada:player#46087> by holding him without a hit in 4 at-bats.

After the game, Shimada seemed more concerned with his team taking the loss than with the demise of his streak.

"I had some great looks at some pitches that I should have hit," he said. "I missed some that I shouldn't have swung at. All in all, I wasn't much help with the bat today."

For the year <Shimada:player#46087> has hit .335 with 8 home runs, 42 RBIs and scored 45 runs.
