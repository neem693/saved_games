Kyuko May Incur Fine for 'Childish Behavior'
Tokyo Yakult reliever <Kentaro Kyuko:player#37386> is in hot water with manager Mitsuru Manaka for a series of pranks aimed at other teammates. "These guys are adults," said the Swallows skipper. "And they're supposed to be professionals. Why Kentaro is acting like a clown is beyond me." According to Manaka, Kyuko will be fined if the behavior continues. However, Kyuko, doesn't understand why his manager is getting all worked up. "I'm just having a little fun, blowing off some steam. He doesn't need to call me out in public. And fining me would be taking it way too far. It's embarrassing to be singled out like that. I don't know. I guess I need to take things a little more seriously from now."
