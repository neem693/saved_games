Palm Beach-Charlotte Brawl, Sosa and Burke Suspended
Yesterday at Roger Dean Stadium <Edmundo Sosa:player#33229> and <Brock Burke:player#19385> got into each other's space and then into each other's face. They began to grapple and fell to the ground. That's when it boiled over into a full-fledged bench-clearing tussle between the <Palm Beach Cardinals:team#238> and <Charlotte Stone Crabs:team#240>. Reason finally prevailed as the umpires restored order. After much discussion, only the two major combatants were ejected from the game.

Today the league office notified the ballclubs that <Sosa:player#33229> will have to sit out 3 while <Burke:player#19385> would be given a 7-game suspension for their roles in the brawl. 

So far this year <Sosa:player#33229> has hit .288 with 2 home runs, 31 RBIs and 30 runs scored.
