League Suspends Fightin Phils Stankiewicz 4 Games
The <Reading Fightin Phils:team#198> were hoping for a more lenient ruling from the league office, but they didn't get it. In yesterday's game at FirstEnergy Stadium against the <Akron RubberDucks:team#193>, Fightin Phils second baseman <Drew Stankiewicz:player#607> was ejected by the home plate umpire after he vociferously questioned a third-strike call.

The commissioner's office issued a 4-game suspension, saying the league would not tolerate a player behaving in that manner. The disgruntled Stankiewicz refused to leave the field and kicked dirt on the umpire's shoes. His manager tried to keep him away from the umpire and physically had to remove him to the dugout with the help of the two other coaches.

Reached for comment after getting the suspension notice, Stankiewicz said he was too disgusted to talk about it.

So far this season <Stankiewicz:player#607> has 3 home runs and a .221 batting average.
