APP Awards Best Batter Prize to Perez
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Appalachian League, but last week <Danienger Perez:player#19425> of the <Pulaski Yankees:team#302> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Perez rocked opposing pitching for a .588 average (10-for-17), no home runs and 1 RBIs to come away with the award.
