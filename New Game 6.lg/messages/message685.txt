TFBL Pitcher of the Month Goes to Poreda
In April when <Kaohsiung Guardians:team#465> reliever <Aaron Poreda:player#23876> was beckoned in from the bullpen, it spelled "Relief" with a capital "R." He usually put a very quick end to any budding rallies. For his sensational mound work he was voted the Taiwan Future Baseball League Pitcher of the Month.

The Kaohsiung reliever had 5 saves for the month with a 0-0 record and 1.50 ERA. He made 6 relief appearances, hurled 6 innings, yielded 5 hits, fanned 9 and walked 1.
