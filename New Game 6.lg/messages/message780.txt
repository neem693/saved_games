Kuo-Yu Lin's Home Robbed
<Kuo-Yu Lin:player#41915>'s home in <Lamigo:team#463> has been robbed, the reliever has told media.

"They took pretty much everything, completely cased the place," said the 28-year-old grimly. "I'm not sure if it was someone who knew I was a pro ballplayer or just a random thing, but it feel terrible either way."

Thankfully, Lin said, his family wasn't home during the incident.

"We can replace possessions, but no one was hurt, that's the main thing."

<Yao-Hsun Yang:player#37015> said morale around the clubhouse is low, but they are trying to band together to help Lin through the situation.

"We're all bummed out, but happy he's OK and hopefully they can catch the guy who did this," he said.
