Fighters Yano Suspended
The <Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters:team#413> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Yomiuri:team#422> at Tokyo Dome. One in particular -- <Kenji Yano:player#37138>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Fighters first baseman gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Yano lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Yano told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Yano for 2 games.

So far this year <Yano:player#37138> is batting .238 with no home runs.
