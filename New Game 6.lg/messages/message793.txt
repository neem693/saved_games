They never learn!
Barely a week after their last outburst, <Kentaro Kyuko:player#37386> and <Hiroki Yamada:player#37100> were back at it. This time, <Kentaro Kyuko:player#37386> was caught screwing his teammate's helmet to his locker. When <Hiroki Yamada:player#37100> went to grab it, he ended up ripping the whole locker out of the wall. Manager <Mitsuru Manaka:coach#1477> fined <Kentaro Kyuko:player#37386>, and was overheard telling him, "You'll pay for the **** repairman to come in and fix this!"

When confronted by the media, <Kentaro Kyuko:player#37386> was quoted as saying, "I'm sorry that my prank got out of hand. We just came off a tough loss, and I just wanted to lighten the mood."
