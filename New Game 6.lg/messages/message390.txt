Detroit 1B Will Miss 4 Games, Suspended by League
The <Detroit Tigers:team#40> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Cleveland:team#38> at Progressive Field. One in particular -- <Miguel Cabrera:player#17916>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Tigers first baseman gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Cabrera lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Cabrera told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Cabrera for 4 games.

On the season, <Cabrera:player#17916> is batting .179 with 3 home runs and 5 RBIs. He has played in 10 games.
