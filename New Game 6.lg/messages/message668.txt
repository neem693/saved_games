Senga April's Best Hurler in JPL
When <Kodai Senga:player#37626> takes the hill, chances are good for a <Fukuoka SoftBank:team#412> victory. At least that's the way it was in May.

He excelled with a 4-0 mark and 2.25 ERA in 5 starts, tossed 36 innings, fanned 43 and held others clubs to a .266 average.

That's why the Hawks star was honored today as the Pitcher of the Month by the Pacific League.
