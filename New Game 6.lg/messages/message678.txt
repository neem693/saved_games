KBO Names Rookie Star of the Month
<Baek-ho Kang:player#45984> is still a bit shy, but then, who could blame the newest Korean Baseball Organization Rookie of the Month honoree? He hasn't been around the league long enough to fully know the ropes yet, despite the fact that he's putting up veteran-like numbers.

In April the <kt:team#459> hitter tagged opposing pitching for a .355 average with 22 hits, 3 home runs and 10 RBIs.
