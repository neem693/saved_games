Season Over for Garcia
Obviously disappointed, <Luis Garcia:player#45735> confirmed today that his season is officially over. The <St. Louis (DSL):team#607> reliever offered mostly monosyllabic responses to reporters. "Nope," he said, when asked if he might possibly return this year. The 17-year-old Garcia suffered a torn flexor tendon in his elbow on 06/15/2018 and has been out of action since.
