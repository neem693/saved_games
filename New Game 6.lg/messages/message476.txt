Huang Injured Lifting Weights
All ballplayers want to get stronger. Not a lot of them actively think about the dangers of weightlifting. The danger has become real for <Wei-Chen Huang:player#39837> of the Monkeys. Huang was injured while going through his normal training routine today. While the injury itself is not thought to be too serious, Huang will miss "a couple of days, at least" according to his manager Jung-Chung Tsai. "It wasn't pretty. He's more or less fine, but this should serve as an important safety lesson for the rest of the clubhouse."
