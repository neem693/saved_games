MID Top Batter Trophy Won by Sanchez
It's perhaps an award he'll win many more times through his career, as at age 22 <Manny Sanchez:player#40858> has a lot of baseball ahead of him.

But for now the young <West Michigan Whitecaps:team#252> star can enjoy the numbers he put up in April, which have garnered him the nod as the Midwest League Batter of the Month.

His breakout month featured a .341 average with 6 home runs, 21 RBIs and 16 runs scored.
