Minnesota's Morrison Suspended 3 Games
The <Minnesota Twins:team#47> were hoping for a more lenient ruling from the league office, but they didn't get it. In yesterday's game at Target Field against the <Toronto Blue Jays:team#59>, Twins first baseman <Logan Morrison:player#23997> was ejected by the home plate umpire after he vociferously questioned a third-strike call.

The commissioner's office issued a 3-game suspension, saying the league would not tolerate a player behaving in that manner. The disgruntled Morrison refused to leave the field and kicked dirt on the umpire's shoes. His manager tried to keep him away from the umpire and physically had to remove him to the dugout with the help of the two other coaches.

Reached for comment after getting the suspension notice, Morrison said he was too disgusted to talk about it.

Morrison is hitting .257 this year with 3 home runs and 8 RBIs. He also has an OBP of .307, 5 walks and scored 13 times.
