Hall Snags FSL Batting Honor in April
At only 22 years of age, <Darick Hall:player#25166> could very well be having many more months like the last this in his career.

That would be great news for fans of the <Clearwater Threshers:team#241>, as April was one to remember for the first baseman and he has captured the Florida State League Batter of the Month award.

On the month he hit .391 with 7 home runs, 21 RBIs and 14 runs scored.
