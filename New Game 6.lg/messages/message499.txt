Matheny Sticks it to CAR Pitchers
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Carolina League, but last week <Tate Matheny:player#21386> of the <Salem Red Sox:team#225> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Matheny rocked opposing pitching for a .370 average (10-for-27), 1 home run and 7 RBIs to come away with the award.

Thus far this year Matheny is batting .268 with 2 home runs, 11 RBIs and 12 runs scored.
