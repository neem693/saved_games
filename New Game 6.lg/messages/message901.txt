Correa Wins AL Best Player Award
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the American League, but last week <Carlos Correa:player#32764> of the <Houston Astros:team#42> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Correa rocked opposing pitching for a .550 average (11-for-20), 5 home runs and 13 RBIs to come away with the award.

This season <Correa:player#32764> is batting .222 with 13 home runs. He has scored 24 runs and driven in 35.
