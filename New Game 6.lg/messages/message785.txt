Dinos End Koo's Streak
It was a doubly miserable day today for <Ja-wook Koo:player#38876> of the <Samsung Lions:team#439>, as he saw his 31-game hitting streak end and his team lose 8-2 to the <NC Dinos:team#446> at Masan Baseball Stadium. The 25-year-old right fielder was held hitless in 4 at-bats by the Dinos.

"Anyone on a 31-game hitting streak is going to be a tough out," NC manager <Kyung-Moon Kim:coach#1465> said later. "But we had a plan and we were careful about it, and got it done."

So far this season <Koo:player#38876> has 9 home runs and a .335 batting average.
