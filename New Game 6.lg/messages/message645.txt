JCL's Top Hitter Selected
<Wladimir Balentien:player#36831> is in the final year of his contract with <Tokyo Yakult:team#420> and today added a timely piece of hardware to his trophy case. Playing in 23 games in April the 33-year-old left fielder ripped Central League pitchers for a .261 batting average, nabbing him the Batter of the Month award.

He also rang up 11 home runs, 27 RBIs and 16 runs scored.

If Balentien keeps up this pace, he'll cost someone a lot of money.
