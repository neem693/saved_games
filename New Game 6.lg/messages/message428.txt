IL's Top Player, Refsnyder of Columbus
The hottest bat of the week belonged to <Columbus:team#157> second baseman <Rob Refsnyder:player#33861>.

He went on a rampage last week against IL hurlers and rapped out 12 hits in 26 at-bats for a .462 average while hitting 2 home runs, driving in 7 runs and scoring 8 runs -- numbers quite worthy of the International League Player of the Week trophy.

<Refsnyder:player#33861> was honored today at a press conference.
