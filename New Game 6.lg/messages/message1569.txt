Season Done for Almonte
Clearly dejected, <Abraham Gilberto Almonte:player#44914> left the <Missoula:team#336> clubhouse nearly in tears this afternoon. He acknowledged that his season is over after sustaining a stretched elbow ligament in a ballgame recently. It brings an early end to the <Missoula:team#336> starting pitcher's season.
