5-for-6 Day for McPhearson
It was a downpour of hits for <Matt McPhearson:player#34205> at Dow Diamond today.

The <Kane County Cougars:team#257> center fielder tore into <Great Lakes:team#247> for 5 hits in 6 at-bats to pace the Cougars to a rain-delayed 14-0 victory. Great Lakes manager <John Shoemaker:coach#450> bemoaned his pitching, speculating his club got flustered by McPhearson's big day.

"He was beating us and we stopped locating well," he said. "That makes you get behind in the count and you can't do that when a guy is hot like McPhearson was today. Not to take anything away from him, but bad location was the story of the ballgame."

<Matt McPhearson:player#34205> singled in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, hit an RBI double in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 6th and struck out in the 8th.

McPhearson is batting .254 this year with no home runs, 10 RBIs and 12 runs scored. He has 29 hits in 114 at-bats.
