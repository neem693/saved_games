The baseball must have looked as big as a balloon to <Jae-won Lee:player#38068> of <SK:team#444> last week. The catcher had quite a 5-game stretch and today he was named the Korean Baseball Organization Player of the Week.

Lee delivered 13 hits in 20 at-bats to hit .650 with 1 home run and 4 RBIs.

This season <Lee:player#38068> is batting .330 with 91 hits and 15 home runs. He has scored 60 times and has 51 runs batted in.
