Season Over for Ahn
Obviously disappointed, <Woo-jin Ahn:player#45945> confirmed today that his season is officially over. The <Hwaseong:team#455> closer offered mostly monosyllabic responses to reporters. "Nope," he said, when asked if he might possibly return this year. The 18-year-old Ahn suffered a torn flexor tendon in his elbow on 06/26/2018 and has been out of action since.
