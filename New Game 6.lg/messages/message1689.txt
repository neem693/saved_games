Wyverns Lee Booms 3 HRs
Some days you can't have it all, as <SK Wyverns:team#444> catcher <Jae-won Lee:player#38068> discovered when he cracked three homers against the <Nexen Heroes:team#441> today, and still lost.

"I have mixed emotions about this game," he said. "It's great to hit three homers, but it's hard to be happy when you lose the game."

"I got three balls to hit and nailed all three of them," he said in the postgame interview.

<Jae-won Lee:player#38068> flied out in the 2nd, hit a solo-shot off <Ju-won Oh:player#38422> in the 5th, hit a solo-shot off <Bo-geun Lee:player#38425> in the 6th, grounded out in the 8th, walked in the 10th and hit a solo-shot off <Ju-hyun Park:player#43327> in the 12th.
