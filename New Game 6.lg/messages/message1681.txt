<M.T. Minacci:player#20870> has to call it a season. The <Chicago N (AZL) Cubs 1:team#312> starting pitcher learned today that the full extent his injury suffered on 06/27/2018 is worse than hoped. He will not play again this year according to club doctors, who diagnosed the injury as a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament and stated that he would not be able to play for 8-9 months.   The team will likely place Minacci on the disabled list today.
