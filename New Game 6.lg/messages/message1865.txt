League Suspends San Diego (DSL) CF Santos
The <San Diego (DSL) Padres 1:team#600> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Detroit (DSL):team#794> at Ballpark of Casta√±uelas. One in particular -- <Angel Santos:player#712>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Padres 1 center fielder gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Santos lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Santos told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Santos for 4 games.

So far this season Santos is hitting .171 with 1 home run, 10 RBIs and 5 runs scored. He has 13 hits in 76 at-bats and a .229 OBP.
