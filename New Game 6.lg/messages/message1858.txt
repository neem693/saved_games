Boyer Given 2-Game Suspension
The <Lake County Captains:team#264> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Dayton:team#248> at Fifth Third Field. One in particular -- <Jordan Boyer:player#19926>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Captains third baseman gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Boyer lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Boyer told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Boyer for 2 games.

So far this season <Boyer:player#19926> has no home runs and a .291 batting average.
