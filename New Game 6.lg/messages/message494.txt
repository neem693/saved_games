Jang Calls Out Local Press for 'Negativity'
It's been a tough season for the Heroes, but manager Jeong-seok Jang says he's fed up with the media for their negativity.

"We've got a great bunch of guys out there. I know for a fact that this team is leaving it all out on the playing field every single game. There's no way you can question their dedication," said Jang. "So for this team to be constantly dogged by the media... well, it's just not right. If you're gonna print negative stuff in the paper and make negative comments on the radio, go ahead and direct them my way. I'm the manager. The buck stops with me. Just cut my guys a little slack, will ya?"

Jang has guided his team to a 10-15 record this season, good for 8th place in their division.
