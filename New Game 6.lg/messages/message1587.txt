Hill Wins EL Player of the Week Prize
<Logan Hill:player#776> must have thought he was in seventh heaven this week. First he went on a sensational hitting spree, belting the ball at a .647 pace, then the <Altoona:team#194> right fielder finds out he has been selected the top performer and gets the Eastern League Player of the Week Award.

Asked what his hitting philosophy was, <Hill:player#776> quipped to the BNN reporters, "Well, my theory of hitting is to just watch the ball as it comes in and hit it."

It was a good week's work for Hill. He hit .647 average (11-for-17) with 2 home runs and 7 RBIs.

This year <Hill:player#776> has hit at a .313 clip with 67 hits, 13 home runs, 42 RBIs and 37 runs scored.
