TFBL Awards Player of the Week Trophy
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Taiwan Future Baseball League, but last week <Tsu-Hao Tung:player#43121> of the <LA NEW Bears:team#467> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Tung rocked opposing pitching for a .417 average (5-for-12), 4 home runs and 5 RBIs to come away with the award.
