Hartford's Mundell Collects April Batting Honor
<Hartford Yard Goats:team#188> fans believe they've got a talented young star in <Brian Mundell:player#23310>.

He did nothing to dissuade that notion in April, as he hit .400 with 4 home runs, 16 RBIs and 21 runs scored.

The end result was the first baseman being named the Eastern League Batter of the Month.
