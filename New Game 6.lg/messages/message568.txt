6 Hits for Twins Mauer
The <Cincinnati Reds:team#37> downed the <Minnesota Twins:team#47> 13-11 today at Target Field, in spite of the best efforts of Minnesota first baseman <Joe Mauer:player#18216>. Mauer lashed the ball all over the park in a 6-hit explosion, finishing with a 6-for-6 line -- and a loss. 

"I don't remember a better day batting, but it sure is disappointing to lose the game," he said to BNN reporters in the postgame interview. "A win would have made the day much sweeter."

Asked if he would adjust his strategy next time the Reds face Mauer, Cincinnati manager <Bryan Price:coach#261> said "absolutely not."

"Our strategy was to not give him good pitches to hit," he said. "We didn't do that, and he worked us over. Thankfully, we won anyway, and next time we'll pitch to him better."

<Joe Mauer:player#18216> singled in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, hit an RBI double in the 4th, doubled in the 6th, singled in the 8th and singled in the 9th.

Thus far this season in 23 games Mauer is batting .269 with 2 home runs, 11 RBIs and 11 runs scored. He has 25 hits in 93 at-bats.
