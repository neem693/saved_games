Injury to Lopez A Career-Ender
All good things must end. So it does for the career of <Detroit (DSL):team#616> reliever <Johan Manuel Lopez:player#46015>. This morning, Lopez announced his retirement from baseball. The decision does not come as a complete surprise. Lopez suffered irritation of the ac joint in his shoulder earlier this season. Treatment of the injury has not resulted in much progress. And Lopez, cognizant of the odds, had already called his return doubtful. The team will continue to explore its options for replacing Lopez.
