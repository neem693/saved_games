NYP Votes Spinners Poirier Top Player
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the New York-Penn League, but last week <Nick Poirier:player#26635> of the <Lowell Spinners:team#287> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Poirier rocked opposing pitching for a .448 average (13-for-29), 1 home run and 4 RBIs to come away with the award.
