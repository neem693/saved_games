Blue Jays End Jones's Streak
The <Toronto Blue Jays:team#59> pitching staff did its job today, holding hot-hitting <Adam Jones:player#18525> hitless in 3 at-bats during the club's 9-4 victory over the <Baltimore Orioles:team#33> at Rogers Centre. The disappointing performance ended a 21-game hitting streak for the center fielder.

"I'm a little down right now," Jones said after the game. "I couldn't get anything going when the team needed me, and I hated to see the streak end, too."

Presently <Jones:player#18525> is batting .296 with 10 home runs and 33 RBIs. He has played in 63 games and scored 36 times.
