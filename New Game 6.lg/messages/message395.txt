Fans at Dodger Stadium witnessed the <Los Angeles Dodgers:team#45> blank the <Oakland Athletics:team#50>, 5-0 behind a superb effort by starter <Clayton Kershaw:player#18977>. The <Los Angeles:team#45> left-hander allowed 4 hits in recording the shutout.

"Clayton was good today but I don't want to focus too much on a single game," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said later. "If you're capable of playing at this level, you're capable of having a good game. The real question is if you can learn from that game and repeat it."
