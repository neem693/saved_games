League Suspends Inoa
It was both entertaining and embarrassing to see. <Texas (DSL):team#585> second baseman <Cristian Inoa:player#2113> really got rowdy at El Toro Complex yesterday in a game against the <Boston (DSL) Red Sox 1:team#584>. It all started with a called third strike and ended up with <Inoa:player#2113> being ejected from the game. In between he screamed at several umpires, kicked dirt on them and made several obscene gestures. All of this is frowned upon by the league office. Today they suspended Inoa for 3 games.

He could not be reached today for comment.

<Inoa:player#2113> is batting .094 with 0 home runs and 2 RBIs this season.
