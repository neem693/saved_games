AL Pick for Top Pitcher in June is Miller
<Andrew Miller:player#18496> has been around the league long enough to know that relievers are often overlooked. That has never stopped him from doing what he does best -- and he did it extremely well in June and stole away with the American League Pitcher of the Month award.

The <Indians:team#38> bullpen ace collected 9 saves and 20 strikeouts in 16.2 innings, holding the opposition to a .180 average and posting a 2.16 ERA and a 2-0 record.

For the year <Miller:player#18496> has made 38 relief appearances and claimed 23 saves. His record is 4-2 with 55 strikeouts in 44.2 innings and a 1.81 ERA.
