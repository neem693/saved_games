Tohoku Rakuten Blanks Lions, Norimoto at His Best
The <Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles:team#415> shut out the <Saitama Seibu Lions:team#416> 5-0 today behind the strong pitching of <Takahiro Norimoto:player#37535>. <Norimoto:player#37535> surrendered only 3 hits in recording the complete-game victory, and struck out 8.

Following the last out, Norimoto appeared to celebrate a little too boisterously for Saitama Seibu manager <Norio Tanabe:coach#1562>, who could be seen scolding the famously outspoken right-hander as the clubs left the field. Norimoto's own manager then intervened with some words for his counterpart.

The Lions skipper would not comment on the exchange, but at the Golden Eagles press conference, Norimoto confirmed that it was regarding the celebration.

"He basically told me I was being a lousy winner," Norimoto said.

"And I told him he was being a lousy loser," Tohoku Rakuten manager Masataka Nashida added.

This season <Norimoto:player#37535> has registered 4 wins and 1 loss in 7 starts with a 1.00 ERA.
