Evangelista Selected Top Player
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Dominican Rookie League, but last week <Juan Evangelista:player#42319> of the <Washington (DSL) Nationals:team#605> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Evangelista rocked opposing pitching for a .560 average (14-for-25), no home runs and 9 RBIs to come away with the award.
