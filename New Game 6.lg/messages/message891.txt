20-Game Streak Ends, Simmons Hitless
<Los Angeles:team#44> shortstop <Andrelton Simmons:player#30400> experienced something against the <Tampa Bay Rays:team#57> he hadn't experienced a while: a hitless game.

The Rays pitching corps quieted his hot bat and snapped his streak at 20 games, but his teammates picked up the slack to lead the Angels to a 4-2 victory at Angel Stadium of Anaheim.

"Hey, ain't nothin' bad about a losing a 20-game hitting streak," Simmons joked with reporters after the game. "Now you guys will have to find someone else to bother for stories."

<Simmons:player#30400> is presently hitting at a .349 pace with 4 home runs and 34 RBIs. He has played in 46 games and scored 35 times.
