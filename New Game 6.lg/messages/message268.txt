Tokyo Yakult Swallows' Team Leader, Keiji Obiki Riled Up With Hitting Coach
Normally a leader in the clubhouse, <Keiji Obiki:player#37261> is rumored to have expressed a desire for the team's hitting coach <Ryuji Miyade:coach#2463> to demand more of the other players who "don't carry their weight around here." According to an anonymous teammate, <Obiki:player#37261> reacted to the rumor of the news getting out to the media by saying, "It sounds worse than it was," but admitted there's more to the story than just that comment. It seems likely this incident won't necessarily bring the team and the coaching staff closer together.
