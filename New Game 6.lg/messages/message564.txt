Dinos End Park's Streak
<Kun-woo Park:player#38181>'s 25-game hitting streak has now come and gone. It was snapped today as the <Doosan Bears:team#442> suffered a 6-5 setback against the <NC Dinos:team#446>.

Park went without a hit in 4 trips to the plate. He was visibly upset during a postgame press conference, but it appeared that the streak had little to do with it.

"The hitting streak was one of those things where it was fun while it lasted, but I'm not going to lose any sleep about it tonight," he said. "On the other hand, I am going to lose sleep about dropping this game today."

<Park:player#38181> currently has a .322 batting average with 39 hits, 1 homers, 11 RBIs, 17 runs scored and a .364 OBP.
