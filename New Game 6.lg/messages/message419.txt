Great Week for Harrisburg's Pedro Severino 
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Eastern League, but last week <Pedro Severino:player#31411> of the <Harrisburg Senators:team#197> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Severino rocked opposing pitching for a .500 average (11-for-22), 2 home runs and 6 RBIs to come away with the award.
