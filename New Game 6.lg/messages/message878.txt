Beloit's Deichmann Goes Ballistic with 5 Hits
Getting 5 hits in a game doesn't happen every day,  so it was a special occasion for Snappers's <Greg Deichmann:player#1166> at Neuroscience Feild at Fox Cities Stadium today. Deichmann put up a 5-for-6 line against the <Wisconsin Timber Rattlers:team#267>, swinging the bat with authority all day despite his club's eventual 11-9 loss.

"I'm just out there to try and help the team win," Deichmann said after the game. "I had some real good at-bats today. I made good, solid contact and luckily no one caught 'em. I had a great day, but it's disappointing to lose."

Disappointed or not, he still gets his name in the record books. <Greg Deichmann:player#1166> hit a solo-shot off <Jordan Desguin:player#21388> in the 2nd, singled in the 3rd, hit an RBI single in the 5th, singled in the 7th, flied out in the 8th and singled in the 11th.

So far this season Deichmann is hitting .227 with 5 home runs, 24 RBIs and 13 runs scored. He has 30 hits in 132 at-bats and a .314 OBP.
