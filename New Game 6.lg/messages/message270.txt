Defective Pitching Machine May Be to Blame for Chiu Injury
The 7-Eleven Lions announced today that faulty equipment was indeed the cause of a calf injury to <Tsu-Kai Chiu:player#40147>. He suffered the injury while taking batting practice off one of the team's pitching machines. Inspectors found the aging machine to be "mechanically unsound" and suggested that a faulty throwing mechanism may have resulted in the injury to Chiu. Meanwhile, the Uni-President reliever seems to be fully recovered and has already returned to action.
