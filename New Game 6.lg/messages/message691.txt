Fang Injured While Installing Fixture at Home
Fubon catcher and novice do-it-yourselfer <Ke-Wei Fang:player#39733> will miss up to a week of action after suffering a thumb contusion while attempting to install a bathroom fixture. "I never was much of a handyman," joked Fang. "I'm not sure what I was thinking." According to Fang, he was preparing to install a new sink in his guest bathroom when the fixture slipped and mashed his right thumb. "Yeah, it was probably even more painful than it sounds. I was afraid my entire hand was broken for a moment. Luckily, the x-rays came back negative and I should be back in about a week."
