Torres on a Hot Streak, EL Player of the Week
<Gleyber Torres:player#34975> must have thought he was in seventh heaven this week. First he went on a sensational hitting spree, belting the ball at a .500 pace, then the <Trenton:team#192> second baseman finds out he has been selected the top performer and gets the Eastern League Player of the Week Award.

Asked what his hitting philosophy was, <Torres:player#34975> quipped to the BNN reporters, "Well, my theory of hitting is to just watch the ball as it comes in and hit it."

It was a good week's work for Torres. He hit .500 average (9-for-18) with 2 home runs and 4 RBIs.

Thus far this year Torres is hitting .337 with 4 home runs, 13 RBIs and 15 runs scored.
