Wick to Get His Kicks Playing Soccer, Not Baseball
<Rowan Wick:player#33057> has decided to quit baseball and pursue a soccer career. The Missions closer, who was a standout goalkeeper in college, was drafted in the 1st round of the pro soccer draft three years ago by Los Angeles, but chose to play baseball instead. Unfortunately, his career has stalled in the minors and Wick says he's ready for another career change. "Baseball will always be my first love, but I just don't see myself having the same amount of success as I would playing soccer." 

According to pro soccer rules, Wick is now considered a free agent and is therefore eligible to sign with any team.
