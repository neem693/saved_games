Lee May Be Fined for Missed Flight
Word out of wiz camp today is that <Sang-hwa Lee:player#38292> might be fined by the team or benched for the next game as punishment for missing the team flight. "It's unacceptable," said manager Jin-wook Kim. "He should know better and should take responsibility for his actions. Something needs to be done to curb this behavior before it becomes a real problem." Pressed for a comment, Lee simply said, "I overslept. It happens."
