Park Shows Off, Hits for Cycle 
Getting 4 hits is a good day by any measure, but when those include a single, double, triple and a home run -- that's something special. <Kun-woo Park:player#38181>'s day was a special one. 

The right fielder hit for the cycle to spark the <Doosan Bears:team#442> to a 10-6 victory over the <NC Dinos:team#446> at Masan Baseball Stadium today. Doosan manager Tae-hyeong Kim said he thought the whole lineup looked good in batting practice, but had not been expecting anything extraordinary from Park in particular.

"Kun-woo caught me by surprise today," he said. "He looked good before the game, but man, he looked unbelievable during it."

For the day, Park finished with 3 RBI and 3 runs scored to go with his 4 hits.
