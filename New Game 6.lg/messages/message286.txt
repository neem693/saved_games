Missed Bus May Cost Nagai
Word out of Carp camp today is that <Atsushi Nagai:player#46162> might be fined by the team or benched for the next game as punishment for missing the team bus. "It's unacceptable," said manager Katsumi Mizumoto. "He should know better and should take responsibility for his actions. Something needs to be done to curb this behavior before it becomes a real problem." Pressed for a comment, Nagai simply said, "I overslept. It happens."
