Choi Arrives Late, Misses Game
Showing up late for work can be costly. <Dong-hwan Choi:player#38525> is expected to be fined or benched for the team's next game after getting to the ballpark 30 minutes late. "I got stuck in traffic!" screamed Choi as he ran down the hallway to talk to manager Joong-il Ryu about the situation. "it's unacceptable," said Ryu. "He should know better and should take responsibility for his actions. Even though this appeared to be an honest mistake, he should take traffic into account. Leave 30 minutes earlier next time!"
