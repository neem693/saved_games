Ramsay Sizzles -- Smokes Carp for 5 Hits
There aren't many who could be pro ballplayers and there are even fewer who could put up 5 hits in a day.

<James Ramsay:player#34556> is one of those rare few, as he went 5-for-5 against the <Hiroshima Toyo (Ni-Gun) Carp:team#432> at Gannosu Recreation Center today. The monster effort from the 26-year-old left fielder helped the <Fukuoka SoftBank (Ni-Gun) Hawks:team#430> take the win, 8-3. 

"We made some bad pitches and he took advantage of it," said Carp manager <Katsumi Mizumoto:coach#2509>. "That's the game, though. Don't make mistakes and you'll win ballgames. Make mistakes and, well, you saw what happened today." 

<James Ramsay:player#34556> singled in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, doubled in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 5th and singled in the 8th.

This season <Ramsay:player#34556> has 2 home runs and a .512 batting average.
