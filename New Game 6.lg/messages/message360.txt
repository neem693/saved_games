KFL Votes Lions Seo Top Player
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Korean Futures League, but last week <Joo-won Seo:player#45911> of the <Gyeongsan Lions:team#450> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Seo rocked opposing pitching for a .500 average (11-for-22), 2 home runs and 4 RBIs to come away with the award.
