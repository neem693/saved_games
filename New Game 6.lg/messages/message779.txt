4-Game Suspension for Golden Eagles Monzon
The <Tohoku Rakuten (Ni-Gun) Golden Eagles:team#425> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <Yokohama (Ni-Gun):team#427> at Yokosuka Stadium. One in particular -- <Javier Monzon:player#19293>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Golden Eagles third baseman gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.

But the disgruntled Monzon lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.

But it got worse after the game, when Monzon told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."

For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Monzon for 4 games.

For the year <Monzon:player#19293> is batting .145 with 1 home run.
