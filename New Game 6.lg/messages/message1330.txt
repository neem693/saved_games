League Suspends Katsuki and Storen for Fisticuffs 
Yesterday at Urawa Baseball Ground <Kazuya Katsuki:player#42966> and <Drew Storen:player#25862> got into each other's space and then into each other's face. They began to grapple and fell to the ground. That's when it boiled over into a full-fledged bench-clearing tussle between the <Chiba Lotte (Ni-Gun) Marines:team#423> and <Tohoku Rakuten (Ni-Gun) Golden Eagles:team#425>. Reason finally prevailed as the umpires restored order. After much discussion, only the two major combatants were ejected from the game.

Today the league office notified the ballclubs that <Katsuki:player#42966> will have to sit out 3 while <Storen:player#25862> would be given a 7-game suspension for their roles in the brawl. 

This year <Katsuki:player#42966> is batting .284 with 7 home runs and 28 RBIs. In 54 games he has scored 24 times.

This season <Storen:player#25862> has made 5 relief appearances with no saves. His won-lost record is 0-0 with a 1.42 ERA.
