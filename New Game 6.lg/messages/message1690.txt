Basil to Hang Up Cleats
The day has come for <Willy Basil:player#46026> to call it a career. The <Pittsburgh (DSL):team#592> starting pitcher, because of a torn ulnar collateral ligament, has been out of action for a while. Now, he has decided to retire from baseball. He made it official in a brief appearance to reporters. "I was told I've got an outside shot at playing again," he said. "But I've decided to pursue other options at this time." Best of luck to Basil. The team will surely miss him.

On the year <Basil:player#46026> has worked 15.1 innings with 4 strikeouts en route to a 1-2 record and 2.93 ERA.
