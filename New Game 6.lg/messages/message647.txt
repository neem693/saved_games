April's #1 Starter Named in IL
<Stephen Gonsalves:player#34091> took a much-deserved turn in the spotlight earlier today as he accepted the International League Pitcher of the Month award for April.

The 23-year-old <Red Wings:team#160> starter is a relative newcomer to the league, but nonetheless racked up an impressive 4-0 won-lost record in 5 starts. This month he fanned 20 batters in 35 innings and compiled a 1.03 ERA.
