Mazeika Socks it to River Cats, Cracks 5 Hits 
A jubilant <Patrick Mazeika:player#22938> joined the postgame press conference at Raley Field today to offer some unusual words of encouragement -- for the <Sacramento River Cats:team#185> pitching staff he had just vanquished.

"It may not have looked like it," said the <Las Vegas 51s:team#162> catcher, "but I saw some awful good pitches today. If luck hadn't been on my side it might have turned out a lot different." 

That would not have been the conclusion of anyone who saw his dominant 5-for-5 hitting performance, which led the 51s to a 9-1 win.

"He made it look easy," said <Dave Brundage:coach#360>, manager of the River Cats. "We never figured out what to do with him. Obviously."

<Patrick Mazeika:player#22938> hit an RBI double in the 1st, singled in the 4th, singled in the 5th, doubled in the 7th and doubled in the 9th.

Batting .306 to date, Mazeika has no home runs and 8 RBIs.
