Season Over for Han
Obviously disappointed, <Ki-joo Han:player#37952> confirmed today that his season is officially over. The <Samsung:team#439> reliever offered mostly monosyllabic responses to reporters. "Nope," he said, when asked if he might possibly return this year. The 31-year-old Han suffered a torn labrum on 05/30/2018 and has been out of action since.
