Takeda Hurls Masterpiece
The <Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks:team#412> shut out the <Yomiuri Giants:team#422> 8-0 today behind the strong pitching of <Shota Takeda:player#37096>. <Takeda:player#37096> surrendered only 4 hits in recording the complete-game victory, and struck out 11.

Following the last out, Takeda appeared to celebrate a little too boisterously for Yomiuri manager <Yoshinobu Takahashi:coach#2510>, who could be seen scolding the famously outspoken right-hander as the clubs left the field. Takeda's own manager then intervened with some words for his counterpart.

The Giants skipper would not comment on the exchange, but at the Hawks press conference, Takeda confirmed that it was regarding the celebration.

"He basically told me I was being a lousy winner," Takeda said.

"And I told him he was being a lousy loser," Fukuoka SoftBank manager Terushi Nakashima added.

Up to now <Takeda:player#37096> has recorded a record of 10-0. In 13 starts he has fanned 85 batters in 98.2 innings with a 2.55 ERA.
