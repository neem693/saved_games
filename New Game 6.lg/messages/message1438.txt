Syracuse Loses Smith for Season
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <Syracuse:team#167>'s <Chris P. Smith:player#34208> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 06/12/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Smith said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Smith has been out of action since he suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament.

<Smith:player#34208> has no saves in 33 relief appearances this season with a 3-3 record and 5.26 ERA.
