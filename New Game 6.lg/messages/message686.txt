Kansas City Befuddled by Sale
The <Boston Red Sox:team#34> shut out the <Kansas City Royals:team#43> 6-0 today behind the strong pitching of <Chris Sale:player#30245>. <Sale:player#30245> surrendered only 3 hits in recording the complete-game victory, and struck out 13.

Following the last out, Sale appeared to celebrate a little too boisterously for Kansas City manager <Ned Yost:coach#889>, who could be seen scolding the famously outspoken left-hander as the clubs left the field. Sale's own manager then intervened with some words for his counterpart.

The Royals skipper would not comment on the exchange, but at the Red Sox press conference, Sale confirmed that it was regarding the celebration.

"He basically told me I was being a lousy winner," Sale said.

"And I told him he was being a lousy loser," Boston manager Alex Cora added.

His record this season is 4-2 in 7 starts and <Sale:player#30245> has a 2.91 ERA.
