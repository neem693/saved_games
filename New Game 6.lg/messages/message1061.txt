25-Game Hitting Streak for Chono
The <Yomiuri Giants:team#422> may have proven to be mere mortals today as they lost 11-6 to the <Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters:team#413>, but <Hisayoshi Chono:player#37313> continued to hit like a god.

The right fielder collected 3 hits in 5 at-bats in the loss and extended his hitting streak to 25 games.

"Chono is playing great and is on fire right now," Giants manager Yoshinobu Takahashi said. "Hopefully his play can spark the rest of our team and help us pick up some wins."

Chono was apparently not happy with the game and when pressed by reporters in the locker room only said "nothing else matters but the loss."
<Hisayoshi Chono:player#37313> doubled in the 1st, hit a two-run home run off <Yuya Fukui:player#37043> in the 3rd, flied out in the 5th, grounded out in the 7th and singled in the 9th.

So far this year <Chono:player#37313> has 9 home runs and a .315 batting average.
