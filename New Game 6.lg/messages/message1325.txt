No Comeback This Season for Hauschild
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <Fresno:team#183>'s <Mike Hauschild:player#32914> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 06/06/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Hauschild said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Hauschild has been out of action since he suffered a torn flexor tendon in his elbow.
