SAL's Star Player Named
With some great hand-eye coordination and a sweet, compact swing, <Augusta GreenJackets:team#270> left fielder <Jacob Heyward:player#34579> took the South Atlantic League by storm this past week to take the latest Player of the Week honors.

"The ball was looking like a beach ball all week," a happy <Heyward:player#34579> said to BNN reporters. "When it's that big, it doesn't matter where they throw it -- I can hit it anywhere."

The 22-year-old left fielder hit .400 (8-for-20) last week with 6 home runs, 8 RBIs and 8 runs scored.

This year <Heyward:player#34579> is hitting .279 with 11 home runs and 27 RBIs to his credit. He has gotten on base at a .362 clip and scored 26 runs.
