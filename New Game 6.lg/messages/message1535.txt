Early Season End for Marquez
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <Eugene:team#295>'s <Brailyn Marquez:player#1325> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 06/17/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Marquez said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Marquez has been out of action since he suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament.
