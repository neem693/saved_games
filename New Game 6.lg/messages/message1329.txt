Randolph's 24-Game Hit Streak Ends
<Clearwater:team#241> left fielder <Cornelius Randolph:player#27077> went 0-for-3 today in <Clearwater:team#241>'s 5-4 triumph over the <Charlotte Stone Crabs:team#240>, snapping his 24-game hitting streak.

Randolph spoke to BNN after the game and said he "knew the hitting streak would end sooner or later."

"I just would have preferred later," he said with a laugh. "It was fun though."

When Randolph made an out in his last chance at the plate, his teammates congratulated him in the dugout. In the clubhouse after the game, he seemed unbothered by the streak ending.

"There's nothing scientific about it, that's for sure," Stone Crabs manager <Jim Morrison:coach#562> said of Randolph's streak. "He had a nice little run. Let him start another one when we finish the series here."

This season <Randolph:player#27077> is batting .311 with 56 hits, 10 home runs, 34 RBIs, 33 walks, .419 OBP and has scored 31 runs. He has played in 48 games.
