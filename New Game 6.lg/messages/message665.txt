Cedar Rapids's Lugo MID Top Pitcher 
When <Cedar Rapids:team#255> reliever <Sandy Lugo:player#42042> strolled in from the bullpen in April, it did not bode well for the opposing team. He usually put a quick end to any budding rally. For his excellent mound work he was named the Midwest League Pitcher of the Month.

The Kernels reliever had 9 saves for the month with a 2-0 record and 1.17 ERA. He made 15 relief appearances, hurled 15.1 innings, yielded 9 hits, fanned 10 and walked 4.
