Injury Brings Season to End for Cooper
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <Connecticut:team#288>'s <Shane Cooper:player#25841> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 06/18/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Cooper said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Cooper has been out of action since he suffered a concussion.
