Injury Brings Season to End for Rosario
"Not what I wanted to hear," said <San Diego (DSL):team#600>'s <Brayan Rosario:player#44024> to reporters this afternoon, as he revealed that the injury he sustained on 06/20/2018 would force him to miss the rest of the season. "The doctor made it clear," Rosario said. "There's no chance for me -- none at all -- to come back this year. That's the last thing I wanted to hear." Rosario has been out of action since he suffered a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament.
