Lindblom Comes To Training Camp Muscled Up
When training camp began this spring for the Bears, <Josh Lindblom:player#29> walked into the clubhouse with a new mind and...a new body. 

Over the offseason, Lindblom added 10 pounds of pure muscle. Lindblom attributes his new look to his intensive off-season workout regimen, which he compared to that of a football player. He also did a lot of biking around the Doosan area, and ventured out for hikes as well.

"I'm in the best shape of my life - I'm stronger and quicker than ever before." <Lindblom:player#29> said with great confidence. "I'm ready to have the best year of my career," he said.
