Personal Message from Owner Jang-seok Lee: New Goals
ORA,

Welcome to the Nexen Heroes organization. I trust that our working relation will be a good one. 
I will submit some new goals each year that I would like to see you accomplish. As well as winning on the field and turning a profit, completing these goals is the best way to keep me happy:

Play close to .500 ball this season
Acquire a Most Valuable Player Award winner
Keep building your team up, in order to reach the playoffs in the next 6 seasons

I will check in periodically throughout the year with your progress.  Good Luck!
