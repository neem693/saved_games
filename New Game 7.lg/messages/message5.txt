Woo Comes To Training Camp Muscled Up
When training camp began this spring for the Lions, <Kyu-min Woo:player#37479> walked into the clubhouse with a new mind and...a new body. 

Over the offseason, Woo added 10 pounds of pure muscle. Woo attributes his new look to his intensive off-season workout regimen, which he compared to that of a football player. He also did a lot of biking around the Samsung area, and ventured out for hikes as well.

"I'm in the best shape of my life - I'm stronger and quicker than ever before." <Woo:player#37479> said with great confidence. "I'm ready to have the best year of my career," he said.
