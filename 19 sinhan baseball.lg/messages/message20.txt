Park Working Hard to Give Back
When <Byung-ho Park:player#742> isn't on the diamond, he enjoys working with the less fortunate. 
Explaining his reasoning he said, "Growing up poor in Seoul, South Korea, my family and I often had to rely on the community to help me get through tough times. Now that I'm doing well financially, I want to give back and I am working hard to try and get my team and teammates to do the same. Honestly, I do this for selfish reasons," he continued with a smile, "nothing makes me feel better than working these kids and helping them to succeed."
