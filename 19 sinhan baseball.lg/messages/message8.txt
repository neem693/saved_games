Kyu-min Kim is a long, lean athletic left fielder who was born in Goyang, South Korea. He is a defensive marvel with skills still developing toward excellence. He is quick on the basepaths. However, his hacking tendencies limit his chances of hitting for a high average. Kim likely won't amount to more than organizational depth.
