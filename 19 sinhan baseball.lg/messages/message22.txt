Ha Bangs Out 5 Base Hits 
It doesn't happen very often, but it did for <Ju-suk Ha:player#1142> today -- a 5-hit effort. He went on a rampage at Masan Baseball Stadium and paced the Eagles to a 17-1 win over the <NC Dinos:team#446>.

After his dynamite batting performance, the <Hanwha:team#440> shortstop told reporters that he "just tried to get in a good count and have a good at-bat. That's all I can control."

His philosophy paid dividends today. He slammed 5 hits in 5 tries and put his name in the record book. <Ju-suk Ha:player#1142> hit an RBI triple in the 1st, walked in the 2nd, hit a GRAND SLAM off <Hyun-sik Jang:player#1283> in the 3rd, hit a two-run double in the 4th, singled in the 7th and singled in the 9th.
