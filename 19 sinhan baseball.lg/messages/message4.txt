Nam Wraps Up Scouting Trip
<In-hwan Nam:coach#228> has just got back from scouting center fielder <Kyu-min Kim:player#1154>.

His current ability is rated as 0.5 stars, relative to the KBO. His potential, again relative to the KBO, is  0.5 stars.  Here is the complete scouting report: 

Kyu-min Kim currently plays in the Korean Futures League for the Hwaseong Heroes. As a left fielder he grades out as a superior defender. He has solid speed on the basepaths. He struggles to put the bat on the ball and that limits his offensive potential. Kim may secure a position, but only if other options are exhausted.
